# Bee Smalltalk

This is Bee, an implementation of a Smalltalk-80 derived environment. Bee has been
designed for running on top of modern JIT-based runtime systems on 64-bit architectures. 


## Build Instructions

This repository is thought for being built through other modular language implementation
frameworks, in particular [powerlang](http://www.github.com/powerlang/powerlang).
